# BME280 sensor API

### Sensor overview

BME280 is a combined digital humidity, pressure and temperature sensor based on proven sensing principles.
Its small dimensions and its low power consumption allow the implementation in battery driven devices such as
handsets, GPS modules or watches.

### Target Application
- Context awareness, e.g.skin detection, room change detection.
- Fitness monitoring / well-being
- Home automation control
- Internet of things
- GPS enhancement(e.g.time-to-first-fix improvement, dead reckoning, slope detection)
- Indoor navigation(change of floor detection, elevation detection)
- Outdoor navigation, leisure and sports applications
- Weather forecast
- Vertical velocity indication(rise/sink speed)

### Feature
- Pressure
- Temperature
